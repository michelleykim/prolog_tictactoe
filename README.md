## How to run
```Haskell
ghci
:l main
main
```
### Troubleshooting
If `Exception: user error (unknown GLUT entry glutInit)` is thrown, try copying `Main.hs` file to the root directory and running the above command again. 
If it still does not work, you might have to install freeglut (or adding `freeglut.dll` and `freeglut.lib` files to the project's root directory).
